                            <p>Clean code is a software development filosophy which consists of using a variety of techniques in order to simplify the writing and reading of a code, making it more understandable either for other developers as well as for yourself.</p>

                            <p> Many developers tend to rush their codes, sometimes owing to the clients' or other team members' pressure. So they usually lack the quality of their code, making it very poor on readablity.</p>

                            <p>When writing a code, we all know that maintaining it clean matters, as we know that later on either someone or ourselves will have to go back and modify it. But sometimes we don't pay much attention in how nieter the things are done, and we start procrastinating the maintenance. Maybe because we were feeling pressured by our boss or teammates, and we give more attention to everything as soon as possible instead of doing it well. This eventually leads to someone having to deal with a mess a code, made in a rush and far from being a good job. </p>

                            <p>Keep in mind that if you <strong>DON'T</strong> keep your code clean, it will later be difficult to read, modify or fix any kind of error, provided that readablity wasn't it's main purpose. These situations not only get you in trouble, but at the same time it might cause the program to run slow, with bugs and crashes.</p>

                            <p>Clean code is very simple and easy to understand. Clean Code respects keeping a well-written structure. Clean code never makes it difficult to understand the designer's intentions, but rather is filled with clear definitions and direct control structures</p>
